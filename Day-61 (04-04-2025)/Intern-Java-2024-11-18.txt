    =   Write a program to print the following series:
            Series-1: 1 2 4 7 11 16 21 .....
            Series-2: 1 3 5 11 21 ......        next number is ((previous*2+1), ((previous*2-1),

    =   What is a class?
        A class is a wrapper around the program. A class protects the programs from
        infiltrators. The concept of class is taken from real life. Class is reuseable.
        A class can be tranformed to an object. Several object may be assembled to
        become another bigger object. Classes are assembled to bcome another object.

    =   What is difference between a class and an object?

        Primary     s1   s2  s3        c1  c2        math      <--- object
                     \   |   /         |   /           |
            ----------\--|--/----------|--/------------|------ instanciation
                       \ | /           | /             |
        Secondary       \|/            |/              |
                      String         class           Math      <--- class


    =   To create a class, the class key word is used. The class keyword is followed by
        a className. The className is an user identifier. The rules for creating the
        user identifier are as follows:
        1.  A class name should start with an uppercase alphabetic character or underscore
            or dollar characters
        2.  It can contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, $ characters only
        3.  Their is no limit for the length of the name

            SumOfAllNumbers         right
            Sum_Of_All_Numbers      right
            24_praganas             wrong
            $hand                   right
            34street                wrong

    =   Which places are used to define user-identifiers:
            1.  class name
            2.  variable name
            3.  function name
            4.  package name

        Other than the class name, the identifiers should have lowercase alphabetic
        characters.

    =   Java is a highly typed language. Before naming a variable, the data type of the
        variable must be defined. There are two cateogies of data types used in Java:
            1.  primitive data type
                There are 8 primitive data types:
                    TYPE        KIND            AUTO-INIT  RANGE                       WRAPPER-CLASSES
                ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                1.  byte        Integer         0          -128 to +127                java.lang.Byte
                2.  short       Integer         0          -32768 to 32767             java.lang.Short
                3.  int*        Integer         0          -2147483648 to 2147483647   java.lang.Integer
                4.  long        Integer         0          -9223372036854775808 to     java.lang.Long
                                                           +9223372036854775807
                5.  float       Floating Point  0.0        32 bits                     java.lang.Float
                6.  double*     Floating Point  0.0        64 bits                     java.lang.Double
                7.  char        Unicode         \0         16 bit                      java.lang.Character

            2.  reference data type
                Rest every thing is reference data type.
                Global variables are automatically initialized with null.

    1 byte = 8 bit = 2^8 = 256 combination

        00000001
        00000010
        00000011

    Requirement was only less than 128 character. So, 7 bits were used to keep the
    data and the last bit was used for parity check. This type of data representation
    is known as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

    When requirement for adding other languages in the computer system croped, the
    byte size was incresed to 16 bit = 2^16 combinations = 32536 combinations.
    This type of data representation is known as UNICODE (Universal Code).

    Reserve discussed:
        for,    if,         else,   byte,   short,  int,    long,   float,  double,
        char,   boolean,    class

    The first requirement of Java is to learn, how to create a class.
    A class has a specific syntax:
        [access-specifier]
        [modifier]
        class <className>
        [extends <parentClass>]
        [implements <interfaceName,....]
        {}


    [access-specifier]
        There are 3 keywords to define the access-specifier:
            1.  public
            2.  protected
            3.  private

    =   How many ways are there to access a class?
        There are 2 ways:
            1.  By object reference
            2.  By inheritance

        class Math {
            public int add(int x, int y) {
                return x+y;
            }
            public int subtract(int x, int y) {
                return x-y;
            }
            public double multiply(int x, int y) {
                return x*y;
            }
            public double divide(int x, int y) {
                return x/y;
            }
        }

        //  Access to a class by object reference
        class Working {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Math math = new Math();
                System.out.println(math.divide(36,5));
            }
        }


        //  Access to a class by inheritance
        class Working extends Math {
            Math() {
                System.out.println(divide(36,5));
            }

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                new Math();
            }

    =   In the whole world of Java, only one class is there whose object may
        be defined in descrit format. That is String class. Anything that is
        embedded within double quote is treated as String object.

        class Example {
            public static void main(String args[]) {
                String title = new String("Hello World");

    =   What is a constructor?
        >   A constructor is used to transform a class into an object
        >   A class is transformed to an object with the help of new operator.
            The new operator calls the constructor of the class.

        >   A constructor name must be same with the class name.
        >   There may be more than one constructor in a class. All constructors in
            a class must have different parameters.

    =   What is computer programming language?
        A programming language is a medium of communication with the computer.
        The computer is fed with a set of instructions in form of notation. The instruction
        is further converted to machine language and the machine executes accordingly.

    =   What is a computer program paradigm?
        A computer language paradigm is a set of concepts and practices that
        define how a program should be written and organized. Each paradigm
        has its own unique features and programming models that help developers
        code efficiently.

    =   There are different paradigms of computer languages:
        >   Procedure Oriented Language
        >   Object Oriented Lanaguage

    =   What is OOPs?
        OOPs stands for Object Oriented Programming?
        In OOPs language, there are certain features to tbe followed:
            1.  Encapsulation and Abstraction
                When the data and the programming code are kept within a single

        1.  Encapsulation
            The data and the code are kept in one unit that is called a class.
            a)  In encapsulation, there is something called Abstraction
                Abstraction is a technique to hide the data from users.

            When more than one method/funciton in the same class has same name
            with different parameter list, it is overloading of methods.
        2)  Overriding of methods
            When a method is redefined in the child that exists in the parent
            class, that is overriding of methods.

    =   Exception handling

    =   Exception handling is a fault resistance technique implemented in Java programming
        language.

    =   To make a program fault resistant, put the program code within a try block.
    =   try is a statement. The try statement is associated with a block. try {}.
        The try statement has another two clauses, they are catch and finally. The
        complete syntax of try statement is as follows:

                try {
                    ..............
                    ..............
                    ..............
                } catch(ClassCastException e) {

                } catch(InterruptedException e) {

                } catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {

                } catch(ArithmeticException e) {
                    System.out.println("This is an exception: "+e);
                }

        When an exception occurs within the try block, an exception object is
        automatically generated. All other lines below the exception line are
        ignored and abandoned. The object searches an appropriate catch where
        it an store the object. On finding the appropriate catch, the object
        is stored and the corresponding block is executed.

    =   What is an exception?
        An exception is a class.

            1)  Checked exception
                >   In checked exception, the compiler checks if the exception given
                    in the catch clause is actually generated from the corresponding
                    try block.
                >   The exception is thrown from the body of the try block but appropriate
                    exception is not given in the catch clauses.
            2)  Unchecked exception
                When an exception inherits the Throwable exception through the
                RuntimeException, it is treated as unchecked exception.

        1.  Passive language
            A type of computer language that is used for user-interface. To display
            good looking screens to the user. This language is not capable of doing
            any computation, can't make decisions.
            Example of these langauges are HTML, SGML, etc.
            HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
            SGML = Standard Generalized Markup Language

            The best editor to user HTML is Visual Studio Code from Microsoft
            HTML is a language of tags. Keywords wrapped within angle brackets <>.
            Mostly the tags have a opening tag and a end tag.
            The end tag starts with a slash character /.
            Tags are nested within other tags.

            1.  Terminator required element
            2.  Self-termnated element

        by java.awt package. These LayoutManagers may be used in Swing.
            1.  FlowLayout
                Provides facility to add component to the Container like a word processor.
                Components are added from left to right. When the line is filled, it
                automatically creates next line.

        The LayoutManager object determines the location and dimension of the component
        that are added to the container active with a LayoutManager. It automatically
        set the size and location of the component.

    =   Movement of the cursor in a ResultSet is possible with the help of the following
        functions:
            1.  beforeFirst()       -   Moves the cursor to the begining of data rows
            2.  first()             -   Moves the cursor to the first row
            3.  last()              -   Moves the cursor to the last row
            4.  afterLast()         -   Moves the cursor to the afterLast row
            5.  next()              -   Moves the cursor to the next row
            6.  previous()          -   Moves the cursor to the previous row
            7.  absolute(int)       -   Moves the cursor to the specified row
            8.  relative(int)       -   Moves the cursor up or down relative to the current
            9.  isBeforeFirst()     -   Returns true if the cursor is in the beforeFirst position
            10. isAfterLast()       -   Returns true if the cursor is in the afterLast position
            11. isFirst()           -   Returns true if the cursor is in the first row
            12. isLast()            -   Returns true if the cursor is in the last row

    =   By default the ResultSet is not editable. To make the ResultSet editable, the
        Statement from which the ResultSet is created must be editable.
            stmt = conn.createStatement(ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);

        The createStatement(int type, int concurrency)

    =   ResultSets are of 3 types:
        1.  ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY     (default)
            When the ResultSet is created from a Forward_only Statement, the cursor
            of the result set can move forward only, it can't move backward.
        2.  ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE
            The result set is scrollable but when other users update the result set,
            the result set doesn't automatically update or recognise the changes.
        3.  ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE
            The result set is scrollable and automatically updates the changes made
            by other users.

    =   ResultSets are of 2 concurrencies:
        1.  ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY      (default)
        2.  ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE

        UPDATE
        1.  Go to that row using absolute(int)
        2.  Update the data in the required column using updateXXXXX
        3.  Call the updateRow() method to make the changes permanent

        INSERT

        2.  Update the content in the insert row using updateXXXXXX
        3.  Call the insertRow() method

        DELETE
        The delete operation is simple. Move the row pointer to the desired row
        and call deleteRow().
        1.  absolute(int)
        2.  deleteRow()

    =   There are 3 types of Statments
        1.  Statement
            The SQL string provided to create the ResultSet is done during creation 
            of the result set. This SQL string is compiled during run-time and make
            the creating of the result set slow.
            1.  Create a Statement
            2.  Create a ResultSet from the Statement object

        2.  PreparedStatement
            When the Statement is created, the SQL statement is also provided. So
            the SQL statement is pre-compiled and first.

            PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement("sql string", resultset-type, resultset-concurency);

            In preparedStatement, the data may be supplied to the SQL statement from
            outside source through place holders.

        3.  CallableStatement
            CallableStatement is similar to PreparedStatement, only it takes the DDL
            SQL commands.

            INSERT INTO tableName VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?, ?);

                setInt(question-mark-no, data-in-int)

        Generic classes encapsulate operations that are not specific to a particular

        String[] person[] = {"Draupadi Murmu","Narendra Modi","Naveen Patnaik","Amit Shah"};

    2.  List is an ordered collection (also known as a sequence)

        List<String> lNames = new ArrayList<String>();
        lNames.add("Draupadi Murmu");
        lNames.add("Narendra Modi");
        lNames.add("Naveen Patnaik");
        lNames.add("Amit Shah");

        List<List<String>> lPerson;

    3.  Vector is an array of objects.

        Vector<String> vNames = new Vector<String>();
        vName.add("Draupadi Murmu");
        vName.add("Narendra Modi");

        The jsp language is divided into 4 subsets
        1. Comment
            There are two types of comments:
            1. hidden comment: this is not displayed on the page source
            2. visible comment: this is visible on the page source. It's purly HTML
               comment
        2. Directives
             Directives in a JSP page do not produce any output in the generated document. 
             They ask the JSP container to perform certain services for the JSP page.
        3. Scripting
        4. Action

    =   The jsp is a tab based language. It opens with a <% element and ends with %> element.
        There are 2 types of jsp declaration:
        1. Convensional presentation which more popular
        2. XML jsp presentation which has more typing load and not popular

WHAT IS PYTHON?
Python is a widely-used, compiled and interpreted, garbage-collected,
high-level programming language and purely object-oriented programming
language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional
programming with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming.
Its everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily
basis, whether they realize it or not.

int i = 10;
{
    int j = 2;
    double p = i / j;
}
System.out.println(p);

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHO DEVELOPED PYTHON?
The seed from which Python sprouted was created by Guido van Rossum,
and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python
as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes
from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's
Flying Circus.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEATURES OF PYTHON:
1.  Easy to use and Read - Python's syntax is clear and easy to read,
    making it an ideal language for both beginners and experienced programmers.
    This simplicity can lead to faster development and reduce the chances of errors.
2.  Dynamically Typed - The data types of variables are determined during run-time.
    We do not need to specify the data type of a variable during writing codes.
3.  High-level - High-level language means human readable code.
4.  Compiled and Interpreted - Python code first gets compiled into bytecode,
    and then interpreted line by line. When we download the Python in our
    system form org we download the default implement of Python known as
    CPython. CPython is considered to be Complied and Interpreted both.
5.  Garbage Collected - Memory allocation and de-allocation are automatically
    managed. Programmers do not specifically need to manage the memory.
6.  Purely Object-Oriented - It refers to everything as an object, including
    numbers and strings.
7.  Cross-platform Compatibility - Python can be easily installed on Windows,
    macOS, and various Linux distributions, allowing developers to create
    software that runs across different operating systems.
8.  Rich Standard Library - Python comes with several standard libraries that
    provide ready-to-use modules and functions for various tasks, ranging
    from web development and data manipulation to machine learning and
    networking.
9.  Open Source - Python is an open-source, cost-free programming language.
    It is utilized in several sectors and disciplines as a result.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HISTORY OF PYTHON
Python was created by Guido van Rossum. In the late 1980s, Guido van Rossum,
a Dutch programmer, began working on Python while at the Centrum Wiskunde &
Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands. He wanted to create a successor to the
ABC programming language that would be easy to read and efficient.

In February 1991, the first public version of Python, version 0.9.0, was
released. This marked the official birth of Python as an open-source project.
The language was named after the British comedy series "Monty Python's
Flying Circus".

Python development has gone through several stages. In January 1994,
Python 1.0 was released as a usable and stable programming language.
This version included many of the features that are still present in
Python today.

From the 1990s to the 2000s, Python gained popularity for its simplicity,
readability, and versatility. In October 2000, Python 2.0 was released.
Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, garbage collection, and support
for Unicode.

In December 2008, Python 3.0 was released. Python 3.0 introduced several
backward-incompatible changes to improve code readability and maintainability.

Throughout 2010s, Python's popularity increased, particularly in fields like
data science, machine learning, and web development. Its rich ecosystem of
libraries and frameworks made it a favourite among developers.

The Python Software Foundation (PSF) was established in 2001 to promote,
protect, and advance the Python programming language and its community.

    =   SET
        Set is like List but the only difference lies:
        1.  It doesn't take duplicate value
        2.  It orders the values
        3.  Set is embedded within curly braces {}
